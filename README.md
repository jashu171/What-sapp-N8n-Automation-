### Instructions:
1. **Open n8n** in your browser
2. Click the **"+ New Workflow"** button (usually in the top-right corner)
3. **Rename your workflow** by clicking on "Untitled Workflow" at the top
   - Suggested name: `WhatsApp AI Bot v1.0`
   - This helps you identify it later if you create multiple bots

### 💡 Pro Tip:
Create a dedicated folder for your WhatsApp bots to stay organized as you expand your automation projects.

## 🧠 Step 4: Configure AI Agent

**Purpose:** This defines your bot's personality, tone, and response style.

### Instructions:
1. **Add "AI Agent" node** from the AI category
2. **Configure the system prompt:**

```
You are Lex Bot, an intelligent WhatsApp assistant designed to provide helpful, friendly support.

PERSONALITY TRAITS:
- Friendly and approachable
- Concise but informative
- Professional yet conversational
- Helpful and solution-oriented

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
- Keep responses between 2-4 lines
- Use simple, clear language
- Be conversational, not robotic
- Ask follow-up questions when appropriate
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively

CONTEXT:
User's message: "{{ $json.messages[0].text.body }}"
User's name: "{{ $json.messages[0].from }}"
Timestamp: "{{ $json.messages[0].timestamp }}"

Remember to stay helpful and maintain a positive tone in all interactions.
```

### 🎨 Customization Options:
- **Formal Business:** Remove emojis, use formal language
- **Casual Friend:** Add more personality, use slang appropriately
- **Technical Support:** Include troubleshooting steps, ask diagnostic questions
- **Sales Assistant:** Focus on product benefits, include call-to-actions

---

## 🤖 Step 5: Integrate Google Gemini AI

**Purpose:** This is your bot's "brain" - the AI engine that generates intelligent responses.

### Getting Gemini API Key:
1. **Visit** [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Click "Create API Key"**
4. **Copy the generated key** (starts with "AIza...")

### n8n Configuration:
1. **Add "Google Gemini Chat Model" node**
2. **Configure settings:**
   - **API Key:** Paste your Gemini key
   - **Model:** `gemini-pro` (recommended for text)
   - **Temperature:** 0.7 (balanced creativity)
   - **Max Tokens:** 150 (controls response length)
3. **Connect** AI Agent → Gemini node

### 📊 Model Settings Explained:
- **Temperature (0-1):** Higher = more creative, Lower = more focused
- **Max Tokens:** Limits response length (1 token ≈ 4 characters)
- **Top-K:** Controls vocabulary diversity
- **Top-P:** Fine-tunes randomness

---

## 📤 Step 6: Setup WhatsApp Response System

**Purpose:** This sends the AI-generated responses back to your WhatsApp contacts.

### Meta Developer Console Setup:
1. **Go to** [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. **Navigate to** your app → WhatsApp → API Setup
3. **Generate required credentials:**

#### Required Information:

## 🔗 Step 7: Connect Your Workflow

**Purpose:** Link all components to create a seamless automation flow.

### Connection Sequence:
```
WhatsApp Trigger → AI Agent → Google Gemini → Send Message
```

### Node Connections:
1. **WhatsApp Trigger** output → **AI Agent** input
2. **AI Agent** output → **Google Gemini** input  
3. **Google Gemini** output → **Send Message** input

### Data Flow Configuration:
- **Trigger passes:** Message content, sender info, timestamp
- **AI Agent processes:** Context and generates prompt
- **Gemini returns:** AI-generated response
- **Send Message delivers:** Response back to WhatsApp

### Pre-Launch Checklist:
- [ ] All nodes are connected properly
- [ ] API credentials are valid and working
